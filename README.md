# Simple Olx-Alert-Site
 


Simple Olx-Alert-Site is a GitHub repository containing the source code for a basic web application that allows users to search for products on the OLX platform and receive real-time alerts whenever new listings matching their search criteria are posted. 

The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, and provides a clean interface for users to input their search queries and view the latest listings. 

The project is ideal for developers who are new to web development or looking to build a simple web application as a learning exercise.
